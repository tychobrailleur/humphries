# Objectives

The aim of the project is to provide quality Open-source tools to support
our own industry.  Another goal is to get acquainted with technologies,
either new or old, which we are not familiar with but that we think are
worth looking at.

# Roadmap

TBD

We have only been able to run Selenium against an old version of Firefox (i.e. 3.6.23) on Ubuntu, not against more recent versions.

       export SELENIUM_BROWSER="*firefox /path/to/firefox"
